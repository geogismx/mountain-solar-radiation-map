# Mountain-solar-radiation-model based on Google Earth Engine <h1>
A GIS-based solar radiation model that allows for the treatment of high spatial and temporal variability in sunâ€“earth position, terrain, and atmospheric effects has not yet been developed for monitoring daily solar radiation. My science innovation covers this gap by complementing existing solar radiation studies with a dynamic spatial perspective, by incorporating the spatial heterogeneity of factors into a model and by applying cloud-based geospatial computing techniques to the problem.
